## Stock market analysis: Using web scraping, Neural Networks and regression analysis in investing

This code demonstrates a web scrapping workflow to get high probability breakout stocks. It also outlines how an LSTM (long short term memory) neural network may be applied to stock predictions and the problems it faces. A much simpler technique to estimate price movement using simple linear regression is introduced as an alternative
